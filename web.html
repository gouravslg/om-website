        "om, in Hinduism and other religions chiefly of India, a sacred syllable that is considered to be the greatest of all the mantras, 
                or sacred formulas. The syllable om is composed of the three sounds a-u-m (in Sanskrit, the vowels a and u coalesce to become o), 
                which represent several important triads: the three worlds of earth, atmosphere, and heaven; thought, speech, and action;
                the three qualities (gunas) of matter (goodness, passion, and darkness); and the three sacred Vedic scriptures (Rigveda, Yajurveda, and Samaveda). 
                Thus, om mystically embodies the essence of the entire universe. <br> <br>
                It is uttered at the beginning and end of Hindu prayers, chants, and meditation and is also freely used in Buddhist and Jain ritual
                The syllable is discussed in a number of the Upanishads (speculative philosophical texts), and it forms the entire subject matter of one, 
                the Mandukya Upanishad. It is used in the practice of Yoga and is related to techniques of auditory meditation. 
                In the Puranas the syllable is put to sectarian use; thus, the Shaivites mark the lingam, or sign of Shiva, with the symbol for om, 
                whereas the Vaishnavites identify the three sounds as referring to a trinity composed of Vishnu, his wife Shri (Lakshmi), and the worshipper."

                Om in Chāndogyopaniṣad

 

Chāndogy- opaniṣad, one of the oldest Upaniṣads, commences introducing Om as,

 

om-ityetad-akṣaram-udg- tham-upāsīta |

om-iti hi-udgāyati tasyopavyākhyānam ||

- Chā.Up.-I.1.1

 

Tr.- One should meditate on the syllable Om, which is Udgītha. One starts singing Udgītha by uttering Om. Of this, the explanation follow. - Chā.Up.-I.1.1

 

***

 

It is in Chāndogya that the doctrine of the sacred character of the syllable Om is gradually developed. Chā.Up.-I.1.5 discusses the syllable Om at length, sets forth rules for the chanters of Sāmaveda, and states that ‘One has to know that Om is the imperishable’.

       -     

vāg-eva-ṛk, prānaḥ sāma, om-iti-etad akṣaram udgīthaḥ |

tad vā etān mithunaṃ yad vāk ca prāṇaśca ṛk ca sāma ca ||

- Chā.Up.-I.1.5

 

Tr.- Vāk is ṛk, prāṇa is sāma, and the word Om is Udgītha. The vāk and prāṇa, of the nature of ṛk and sāma (respectively), are entwined together. - Chā.Up.-I.1.5

 -

***

 

The same Chāndogyopaniṣad subsequently states the origin of Om.

 

prajāpatir-lokān-abhyat- apat-tebhyo-abhitaptebhyas-tra- yī vidyā samprāsravattām-abhyatapat-t- asyā abhitaptāyā etānyakṣarāṇi samprāsravanta bhūr-bhuvaḥ-svar-iti |

- Chā.Up.-II.23.2

 

Tr.- Prajāpati discovered this sacred syllable through meditation. Prajāpati (Virāṭ or Kaśyapa) meditated on the worlds; from them, issued forth the three-fold Vedas. He meditated upon this; thus meditated upon, came forth the syllables bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ and svaḥ. - Chā.Up.-II.23.2
